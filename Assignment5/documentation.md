#The character I used is named Apollo Justice, from hit video game Ace Attorney. The background is a pixel recreation of the courtroom in the games, and the platforms are the scale of justice. All of the design choices are centered around Ace Attorney and themes of law. Apollo is my favourite character, so I decided to add him into the game. 

#I used Piskel because I've never used any of the tools provided before and I just wanted to try out something that could support animation. I learned how to change the grid and also learned that Piskel turns your PNGs very small and blurry.  

#I turned all the pixel images into PNGs and dragged them into the asset folder in the 2d game. It was very easy to do that and ensure all the files would be in the game. Since the game is quite simple, I didn't go through the trouble of assigning them different folders.

#Making the colliders and making it so Apollo would land on the plaforms and be able to jump high enough to reach the second platform was difficult because the scene screen was so small and keeping track of the colliders was exhausting. There was no way around it and I powered through, making it so the game would run smoothly. Other than that, there were no other major issues.
